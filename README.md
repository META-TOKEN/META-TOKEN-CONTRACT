What is Meta Token About
On October 28th 2021, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced Meta, which hopes to bring together the company’s apps and technologies under one new company brand and help people connect and find communities.

$META Token, which has been in the works since FB announced Libra, aims to bridge the gap between the cryptoverse and Meta and provide the currency that sits on top and interchanges within Meta’s universe as well as any ecommerce site.

Meta Token is a deflationary community focused project built on the BSC with a 1 year goal of turning over to a community DAO and with the grand vision of creating to connect everyone in the world. Through a sheer aggregate number of holders, we hope to leverage that to force Zuckerberg or the Meta board to abandon Libra and to replace it with Meta Token or buy us up like he does with all other big projects like IG and Oculus.

Our features include:

Instant Rewards Automatically for hodlers (12% in BUSD)
Giveaways and Airdrops for the community
